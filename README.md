# vue-search
Just a little code test for link switching using Vue.js.

Starting with the search box from the University of Lincoln Library website as a basis, this alters the existing JQuery functions that I wrote to handle switching the href of the "Advanced Search" link and implements an alternative, less heavy, Vue.js equivalent.

Feel free to take a look and use it for your own needs!
